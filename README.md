# Project description 
The objective of the project is to solve the Shinkansen Travel Experience hackathon competition, a machine learning classification problem. The objective is to predict passenger satisfaction  given the customer's overall experience of traveling on the Japanese high-speed passenger train, the Shinkansen Bullet Train. The project can be adapted to solve similar classification problems.
# Files 
The project files include the travel data, customer survey data and jupyter notebook html. More specifically, the datasets consist of: a) the on-time performance of the trains along with passenger information is published in a file named ‘Traveldata_train.csv’ and, b) surveys collected from a random sample of travellers from the same population as the travel data and record the travellers' post-travel experiences in the file named ‘Surveydata_train.csv’. The survey data contains feedback on the parameters of the travel experience including overall experience, the target variable. The files are separated into train and test files.
# Installation instructions 
The html file contains the full code used in the project. It is recommended to convert the file to ipynb format or an alternative that works best with your IDE.
# Contribution guidelines
The highest possible accuracy for prediction is 100%. Any contributions to attain the highest accuracy are welcome! 
# Licensing info.
The data are available on the public domain e.g., kaggle.com and github.com
